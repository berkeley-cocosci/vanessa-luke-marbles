alpha_fitter.py
is the main program that fits a model to some data
both model and data in matrix form

its supporting libraries are:
marbles_data.py
data_matrix_maker.py
model_matrix_maker.py
KL_divergence.py
loglikelihood.py

(I want to improve data_matrix_maker.y to extract data directly from my raw data file, 
instead of from the previously-prepped data in marbles_data.py)
